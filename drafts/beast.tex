\begin{abstract}
Transport Layer Security (TLS) is an protocol that provides communication
security over networks. However, there is a flaw in TLS 1.0 where the initial
vectors for block ciphers are predictable. The BEAST attack, with some
prerequisites and efforts, allows attackers in the middle to decrypt those
encrypted messages.
This paper will demonstrate the procedures of the BEAST attack, and propose
methods in simulation and vulnerability detection.

\section{Introduction}
Transport Layer Security (TLS) has several versions. The specification for TLS
1.0 is RFC 2246\cite{rfc2246}.

\section{Background}
\subsection{A glance at TLS}
\subsection{CBC in block ciphers}
CBC is one of the modes of operation used in block ciphers.

Supposing that $P_1,P_2,\cdots P_n$ are the plaintext blocks, with a initial vector $IV$, we have:

$$
\begin{aligned}
C_1&=E_k(P_1\oplus IV)\\
C_i&=E_k(P_{i}\oplus C_{i-1}) (i\geq 2)
\end{aligned}
$$

to obtain ciphertext blocks $C_1,C_2,\cdots,C_n$.
